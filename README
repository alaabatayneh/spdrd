SPDRD
===================

Speed reading can be boring, and sometimes rather unfulfilling especially when photos are essential to the story, so spdrd is just for that, add photos to speed reading experience.



Usage
-------------

Headlines
Headlines are supposed to skip the speed reading experience, its better to see them in on line rather than broken down to words - with the right pause time.
To add a headline, wrap your title with {{  }} and an H2.

    <h2>{{The Fox and the Crow}}</h2>

Photos
Images can be added anywhere in the articles, they appear and pause until the next image is available.
To add an image, wrap your image path with {''}

    {'images/5.jpg'}
