#SPDRD

SPDRD is the next speed reading experience, because:
  - It recognises heading tags and shows them as one word
  - It sees images and shows them below the speed reader while giving more pause time to see them

## How to use
- Wrap your paragraph like you normally do, with p tag
- Wrap your images between {},  like {'images_path/image.jpg'}
- Wrap your headings between {{}}, like {{Title here}}
